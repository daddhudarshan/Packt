Assignment 

## For this assessment I have used Mavan project with TestNG framework 

* Maven simplifies the management of project dependencies. and declare project's dependencies, including TestNG and other libraries, in the project's pom.xml file. Maven then 
  automatically downloads and configures these dependencies,reducing manual effort and ensuring that you use compatible versions.
* Maven has a vast ecosystem of plugins that can extend its capabilities. we can use plugins to customize your build process, generate reports, and perform various other tasks. For 
  TestNG, there are Maven plugins available to seamlessly integrate TestNG with your Maven projects.
* TestNG, when used with Maven, allows you to parallelize test execution across multiple threads or even on different machines.
* TestNG provides built-in reporting capabilities to generate detailed test reports. When combined with Maven, we can configure TestNG to generate HTML or XML reports, making it easy to 
  track test results and identify issues.
* It can use integrated development environments (IDEs) like Eclipse have Maven support and TestNG plugins. This makes it seamless to develop, run, and manage your tests within the IDE.
* Both Maven and TestNG have active communities and comprehensive documentation, making it easier to find help, share experiences, and troubleshoot issues.

## Install Eclipse IDE and create Mavan Project with TestNG software installed with all dependencies 

## Clone the code from git then right click on testng.xml and Run as 'TestNG Suite' 

## After testing all script Html report will be generated
